\begin{itemize}
\item You write your document in \texttt{plain text} with \cmd{commands} that
describe its structure and meaning.
\item The \texttt{latex} program processes your text and commands to produce a
beautifully formatted document.
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]{\insertsection: Commands \& Arguments}
\begin{itemize}
\item A command starts with a \emph{backslash} \keystrokebftt{\bs}.
\item Some commands take an \emph{argument} in curly braces \keystrokebftt{\{}
\keystrokebftt{\}}.
\item Some commands also take \emph{optional arguments} in square brackets \keystrokebftt{[} \keystrokebftt{]}.
\vskip 2ex
\begin{exampletwouptiny}
\includegraphics[
  width=0.5\textwidth]{big_chick}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]{\insertsection: Environments}
\begin{itemize}
\item The \cmdbs{begin} and \cmdbs{end} commands are used to create many
different environments --- contexts.

\item The \bftt{itemize} and \bftt{enumerate} environments make lists.
\vskip 2ex
\begin{exampletwouptiny}
\begin{itemize} % for bullet points
\item Biscuits
\item Tea
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate} % for numbers
\item Biscuits
\item Tea
\end{enumerate}
\end{exampletwouptiny}

\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]{\insertsection: Mathematics}
\begin{itemize}
\item The \bftt{equation} environment makes a numbered equation.
\begin{exampletwouptiny}
\begin{equation}
  \sum_{k=1}^{n} \frac{1}{2^k}
\end{equation}
\end{exampletwouptiny}
\vskip 2ex

\item Use dollar signs \keystrokebftt{\$} to mark mathematics in text.\\[1ex]
\begin{exampletwouptiny}
% not so good:
Let a and b be distinct positive
integers, and let c = a - b + 1.

% much better:
Let $a$ and $b$ be distinct positive
integers, and let $c = a - b + 1$.
\end{exampletwouptiny}
\vskip 2ex
\item Always use dollar signs in pairs --- one to begin the mathematics, and one
to end it.
\vskip 1em
{\scriptsize In fact, we could have written \bftt{\$...\$} as
\cmdbegin{math}\bftt{...}\cmdend{math}.}

\begin{block}{Hints}
\begin{itemize}
\item Use the \bftt{enumerate} and \bftt{itemize} environments for lists.
\item To typeset a \keystrokebftt{\%} percent sign, \emph{escape} it with a backslash (\cmdbs{\%}).
\item To typeset the equation, use \cmdbs{frac} for the fraction and the \cmdbs{left(} and \cmdbs{right)} commands for the parentheses.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]{\insertsection: Sections}
\begin{itemize}
\item You can use \cmdbs{section}s to group your \bftt{frame}s, and
\bftt{beamer} will use them to create an automatic outline.
\item To generate an outline, use the \cmdbs{tableofcontents} command. Here's
one for this presentation. The \bftt{currentsection} option highlights the current section.
\vskip 2ex
\begin{exampletwouptiny}

\section{Drawings with \protect\tikzname}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]{\insertsection}
\begin{itemize}
\item \tikzname{} is a package for drawing figures in \LaTeX.
\item It defines a powerful drawing language inside \LaTeX{}. Short programs can
draw surprisingly complicated things.
\begin{figure}
\href{http://www.texample.net/tikz/examples/rotated-triangle/}{%
  \includegraphics[width=0.35\textwidth]{rotated-triangle}}
\end{figure}
\item We'll start with simple things. To draw a line in \tikzname:
\vskip 1ex
\begin{exampletwouptiny}
\begin{tikzpicture}
\draw (0,0) -- (1,1); % a line
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{exampletwouptiny}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]{\insertsection: Coordinates}
\begin{itemize}
\item The default coordinates are centimeters, with the usual sense: 
\begin{figure}
\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.5]
\draw[help lines] (0,0) grid (3,3);
\node[below left] at (0,0) {$(0,0)$};
\node[below right] at (3,0) {$(3,0)$};
\node[above right] at (3,3) {$(3,3)$};
\node[above left] at (0,3) {$(0,3)$};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{figure}
\item It helps to draw a grid when you are working with \tikzname:
\vskip 1ex
\begin{exampletwouptiny}
\begin{tikzpicture}
\draw[help lines] (0,0) grid (3,3);
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{exampletwouptiny}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]{\insertsection: Lines}
\begin{itemize}
\item Arrow heads and line styles are specified as options to the \cmdbs{draw} command.
\item End each draw command with a \keystrokebftt{;} semicolon.
\vskip 1ex
\begin{exampletwouptiny}
\begin{tikzpicture}
\draw[help lines] (0,0) grid (3,3);
\draw[->] (0,0) -- (1,1);
\draw[<->, thick] (2,1) -- (1,2);
\draw[<-, thick, dashed] (2,2)--(3,3);

\item Arrows will appear only at the ends of the path.
\vskip 1ex
\begin{exampletwouptiny}
\begin{tikzpicture}
\draw[help lines] (0,0) grid (3,3);
% axes:
\draw[<->, thick] (0,3)--(0,0)--(3,0);
% diamond:
\draw (1.5,0.5) -- (2.5,1.5) -- 
      (1.5,2.5) -- (0.5,1.5) --
      cycle; % close the path
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{exampletwouptiny}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]{\insertsection: Colours}
\begin{itemize}
\item Colours are also specified as options to \cmdbs{draw}.
\vskip 1ex
\begin{exampletwouptiny}
\begin{tikzpicture}
\draw[help lines] (0,0) grid (3,3);

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]{\insertsection: Shapes}
\begin{itemize}
\item \tikzname{} has built-in commands for simple shapes.

\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]{\insertsection: Nodes \& Labels}
\begin{itemize}
\item Use nodes to place text (and math) in \tikzname{} drawings.
\item You can also use nodes as coordinates --- useful for diagrams.
\vskip 1ex
\begin{exampletwouptiny}
\begin{tikzpicture}
\draw[help lines] (0,0) grid (3,3);
\node (h) at (0,0) {H};
\node (x) at (1.5,1.5) {$\xi$};
\node (t) at (3,0) {T};
\draw[->] (x) -- (h);
\draw[->] (x) -- (t);

\section{Notes with \protect\bftt{todonotes}}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]{\insertsection}
\begin{itemize}
\item The \cmdbs{todo} command from the \bftt{todonotes} package is great for
leaving notes to yourself and your collaborators.
\begin{exampletwouptiny}
\todo{add results}
\todo[color=blue!20]{fix method}
\end{exampletwouptiny}
\vskip 2ex
\item Pro Tip: define your own commands with \cmdbs{newcommand}
\begin{minted}[fontsize=\scriptsize,frame=single]{latex}
\newcommand{\alice}[1]{\todo[color=green!40]{#1}}
\newcommand{\bob}[1]{\todo[color=purple!40]{#1}}
\end{minted}
